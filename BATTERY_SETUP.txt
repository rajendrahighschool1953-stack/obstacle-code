BATTERY MONITORING SETUP GUIDE
========================================

Your robot now has battery monitoring capability!

PIN CONFIGURATION:
- BATTERY_PIN = A5 (Analog Pin 5)
- Uses voltage divider to measure battery voltage

VOLTAGE DIVIDER SETUP (for 5V supply):
If your battery is 6-9V, use a voltage divider:

          +Vbat (6-9V)
             |
            [R1] (High value, e.g., 10kΩ)
             |
            [R2] (Lower value, e.g., 10kΩ) --- Connect to A5
             |
            GND

This creates a 1:2 voltage divider, reducing 6-9V to 3-4.5V safe for Arduino.

ADC VALUES (for 5V supply with equal resistors):
- ADC 1024 = ~10V (max battery)
- ADC 512  = ~5V (half supply)
- ADC 350  = ~3.4V (LOW BATTERY THRESHOLD)

CUSTOMIZE THRESHOLD:
Modify this line in the code for your setup:
  const int LOW_BATTERY_THRESHOLD = 350;  // Adjust based on your battery

BATTERY ALERTS:
- LED turns ON when battery is low
- Triple beep alarm sounds
- Serial monitor shows "⚠️  LOW BATTERY WARNING!"
- LED turns OFF when battery recovers (with 50-unit buffer)

TESTING WITHOUT HARDWARE:
Set DEBUG_MODE = true and monitor Serial output
- Battery ADC value and percentage shown every 3 seconds
- Low battery warnings logged

STATISTICS TRACKING:
The robot now tracks:
- Total movement time
- Total avoidance time
- Number of successful moves
- Number of failed avoidances (stuck attempts)
- Current battery level
- Stuck recovery count

Stats are printed every 5 seconds (if DEBUG_MODE = true)
